# ChronoBench
A really bad benchmark test for chrome

**But Why?**
idrc I didn't really have anything to do and also I wanted to see how low quality chromebooks really are. Additionally, I feel as though chrome os is not supported much by people like developers, so why not. Also it is nice to learn about git and such as the last project I made is very unfinished for the sole reason that I just couldn't figure out how to publish it to github and pypi, but it's actually decently usable just not published now. I do still have beef with all the medium articles and others thereof that provided literally no help except for help making many a broken repository, most of which refused to upload. And thats if the article even bothered to upload. I am using my adblocker next time medium, be warned. The only way I found out how to actually successfully create a repository that uploaded and could push changes was through some git doc thing at the 7th page of google. Still don't even know how to unpack the repository without just using pip to install the requirements and running main.py, so I can't really put that in here, which is why this useless text is here. Of course, I know what you are thinking. Why did you read all the way to  this? Well, I suppose just to waste your time just as I did making this project. And by the way, you should really stop reading this because I know that you have productive things to do right now that you are wasting on reading this even though it is the readme so you by all rights follow the generally upheld convention of reading through the readme before failing to use software for the first time, but this is what the weak minded think. If you are a strong minded individual, following the sigma grindset, you should use your rights and stop reading this. Now, if you haven't stopped reading this, I want to congradulate you. You have completely ignored every sign telling you off, and like the strong minded, independant, sigma scorpio you are, did what you wanted. This is a very good demonstration of your rights to not have to listen to me, even though you are still wasting your time. Not very sigma grindset of you. Also I accidentally opened terminal when I typed that uppercase t back there so i hope you're happy because you just witnessed a great deal of sadness as I had to move my cursor a bit to reach the x on the top right of the container. Very insensitive of you. You should stop reading this in shame. Or I will continue to be sad. Alas, I don't even know why I keep trying. Obviously, you will continue reading this until the bitter end. Well, that is just fine and right with me, as I am not even a person. This might be a shock to you, but this is a readme file. A markdown file. It only exists as a collection of bytes, some flipped bits in your ssd or ram, letters represented through your operating system through many protocols and small programs, all consisting of the same matter: flipped bits, ones and zeros. The flipped bits in memory and signals in busses are the only tangible things about this piece of writing that *I* know you amphimorphised. *I*, so humanlike, enough to have probably misspelt amphimorphised, am merely just an illusion, a medium to view a piece of hardware acting as a medium to show the illusion of a piece of code to the hardware's illusion of an operating system, which is, of course, just an illusion made possible by the illusion created by hardware that is the kernel, carefully yet discriminantly and lifelessly acting as a portal in which the hardware can act upon itself to read and execute the many "programs" that all work as one to illude the idea that a piece software you use right now is one whole and worthful thing, the operating system, giving birth to yet another inbred child of it's own, which is this file, and these letters. Anyway, I'm hungry so bye.

**So an actually useful thing now.. ish..**
**INSTALLATION:**

First, clone the repo with the following:
`git clone https://github.com/PINGsback/ChronoBench.git`

Second, navigate to the root directory:
`cd ChronoBench`

Then, install the requirements:
`pip install -r requirements_dev.txt`
note: you may need to substitute pip to something like python3 -m pip depending on how you installed pip and python; chrome is weird

Go to the source directory:
`cd ChronoBench`
Yes, this is a different directory. Bad naming choice on my part, but im too lazy to fix it.

Lastly, run chronobench!
`python3 main.py`
you may need to replace python3 with just python, depending on how you installed it
